       <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>"In abstract mathematics, of course operations alter those particular relations which are involved in the considerations of number and space, and the results of operations are those peculiar results which correspond to the nature of the subjects of operation."</p></blockquote>
     </div>   
     <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6">  
      <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>"In considering any new subject, there is frequently a tendency, first, to overrate what we find to be already interesting or remarkable; and, secondly, by a sort of natural reaction, to undervalue the true state of the case, when we do discover that our notions have surpassed those that were really tenable."</p></blockquote>

    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6">  
      <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>"A new, a vast, and a powerful language is developed for the future use of analysis, in which to wield its truths so that these may become of more speedy and accurate practical application for the purposes of mankind than the means hitherto in our possession have rendered possible."</p></blockquote>
    </div> 
    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6">  
     <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>"It may be desirable to explain, that by the word operation, we mean any process which alters the mutual relation of two or more things, be this relation of what kind it may. This is the most general definition, and would include all subjects in the universe."</p></blockquote>

   <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6">  
     <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>"I never am really satisfied that I understand anything; because, understand it well as I may, my comprehension can only be an infinitesimal fraction of all I want to understand about the many connections and relations which occur to me, how the matter in question was first thought of or arrived at, etc."</p></blockquote>
   </div> 
   <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6">  
    <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>"It were much to be desired, that when mathematical processes pass through the human brain instead of through the medium of inanimate mechanism, it were equally a necessity of things that the reasonings connected with operations should hold the same just place as a clear and well-defined branch of the subject of analysis, a fundamental but yet independent ingredient in the science, which they must do in studying the engine."</p></blockquote>
  </div> 
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6">  
   <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>"In almost every computation a great variety of arrangements for the succession of the processes is possible, and various considerations must influence the selections amongst them for the purposes of a calculating engine."</p></blockquote>
 </div>   
 <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6">  
   <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>"In enabling mechanism to combine together general symbols in successions of unlimited variety and extent, a uniting link is established between the operations of matter and the abstract mental processes of the most abstract branch of mathematical science."</p></blockquote>
